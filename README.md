 ## Str8ts
 >Str8ts is a logic puzzle, invented by Jeff Widderich. It is a grid, partially divided by black cells into compartments. 
 >Each compartment, vertically or horizontally, must contain a straight - a set of consecutive numbers, but in any order (for example 2-1-3-4).
 >The aim is to fill all white cells with the numbers from 1 to N (which N is the size of the grid). No single number can repeat in any row or column.
 >Clues in black cells that number as an option in that row and column, and are not part of any straight.

## Solving Algorithm
>A defined Str8ts puzzle is solved by a genetic algorithm. <br/>
>In package "genetic" in file "GeneticConfig" parameters for solving can be changed.
>For example which type of crossover should be used or probability of mutation.
